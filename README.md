My name is Faith and I'm currently sleeping easy at Kryo as a Front-end engineer. Originally hailing from North Carolina, I've worked in several web app dev shops â€” both as a QA and developer â€” in the nation's capital, but now call Charlotte my home. I'm currently deep diving into the world of e-commerece via Shopify and having a lot of fun doing so.

In my spare time I'm usually hanging off of things, doing yoga, or baking an obscene amount of baked goods. I have a few side projects I'm currently working on (aren't we all?), but we'll talk about that some other time.
