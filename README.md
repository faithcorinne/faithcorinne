### 🏙 Outside of Work

When I'm not working I tend to gravitate towards projects that focus on highly conceptual and unique aspects of design, both physical and digital. I am incredibly inspired by the work I've been taking part in recently and can't wait to unveil it to you all!

#### Ongoing Projects
🍕 Savvor App (2022 → ) — A B2B (and soon B2C) web and mobile application putting food trucks right where they need to be with [@MrWinbush](https://github.com/MrWinbush) <br>
🥀 Rite of Spring (2021 - 2022) — a creative coding experience with @patszot <br>
🎨 [Eteoy Atelier](https://www.eteoy.com/) (2021 → ) — working with a premier black creative to launch the first of his homegrown luxury clothing line

#### Previous Projects
🎨 UI Design for [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/) (2019) — created the first iteration of their homepage, article, and search experiences for the site's initial launch <br>

### ✊🏽 In Support Of ❤️

I'm an active supporter of [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/) and [Carolina Women In Tech (CWiT)](https://carolinawomenintech.org/). As a black engineer, it is incredibly important to me that we support WOC and BIPOC gaining access to this space. **I am always open to coffee chats and mentoring BIPOC and LGBTIQ+ individuals who are interested in getting into all aspects of tech. Please reach out!**
